# Oracle findings

One row per **probe campaign**: a question asked of both implementations, the
number each gave, and how the disagreement was settled. This is the ledger that
makes "cycle-accurate" a checkable claim rather than an assertion.

MAME's `apollo` driver is the runnable oracle. It is **built and instrumented,
never linked** — GPL-2.0-or-later against this core's MIT, so the relationship is
arms-length: MAME runs as a separate program and its output is compared with
ours. See `ext/README.md`.

## The rule that makes this file worth keeping

**A difference is not automatically our bug.** MAME's own driver notes admit gaps
in some FPU operations and operands, Winchester bad-track formatting, and certain
video synchronisation. So every disagreement is *classified*, never silently
"fixed" by moving our number to match:

| Class | Meaning | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ours-wrong` | The oracle is right and we are not | Fix ours; the row cites the probe that proves it |
| `oracle-wrong` | We are hardware-truer than MAME | **Keep ours.** Instrument MAME to demonstrate it, cite the manual page, and record it as a divergence |
| `sub-poll-slack` | Both are within the granularity the probe can actually resolve | Neither is wrong; record the resolution limit so it is not re-litigated |
| `open` | Not yet settled | Must name what measurement would settle it |

Resolving a discrepancy by adjusting our timing until it matches is **forbidden**
— that is trial-and-error parameter search against our own code, and it launders
the oracle's bugs into ours. Characterise the *shape* of the difference first
(proportional? fixed offset? per-instruction-type? per-operand?), because the
shape names the cause.

## Campaigns

None yet. The oracle harness is not built, so no campaign has run and there is
nothing to report. This section stays empty rather than being pre-populated with
plausible-looking rows.

When the first campaign lands, each row carries:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Campaign | What was asked, and the probe that asks it |
| Ours | Our figure, in `AP_TIME_BASE_HZ` units and in the subsystem's own cycles |
| Oracle | MAME's figure, with the instrumentation that produced it |
| Class | One of the four above |
| Evidence | Manual page, patent, or ROM address — an oracle number alone never closes a row |
| Story | Why they differed, in a sentence, so a future contradiction has history |

## Instrumenting the oracle

Temporary instrumentation in `ext/mame` is **always reverted before commit**,
in the oracle's checkout as well as ours. Edit, measure, restore — never
`git checkout <file>` over uncommitted work. A campaign that needed
instrumentation records what was patched and where, so it can be reproduced
without guesswork.

The oracle build is deliberately narrow — one driver, no tools:

```sh
cd ext/mame
make SOURCES=src/mame/apollo/apollo.cpp SUBTARGET=apollo TOOLS=0 -j"$(nproc)"
```

This produces a single-driver binary rather than a full MAME. It is never built
by our CMake, never linked, and CI never compiles it.

**The binary's name moved with MAME's makefile.** Older checkouts produced
`<TARGET><SUBTARGET>` = `mameapollo`; the pinned v0.289 names it after the
subtarget alone, `apollo`. `oracle.py` accepts either and prefers whichever
exists, for the same reason `romset.py` matches ROMs by SHA-1 rather than by
name: neither should break when the `ext/mame` pin moves. Verified against the
built binary — `./apollo -listfull` lists all eleven apollo machines, `dn3000`
through `dn5500`.

**Budget memory, not just cores.** `-j"$(nproc)"` is the wrong instinct on a
small machine: the peak translation units (`luaengine.cpp`, `emumem_aspace.cpp`)
each want ~2.5 Gbyte under `-O3`, measured, so parallelism is bounded by RAM
rather than by CPU. Eight jobs against 8 Gbyte does not build slowly — it swaps
until the machine is unusable. Roughly one job per 2.5 Gbyte of *available*
memory, and on a workstation that is also running a desktop, a cgroup ceiling
turns a bad guess into a failed compile instead of a hard reset:

```sh
systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryHigh=7G -p MemoryMax=9G \
  nice -n 10 make SOURCES=src/mame/apollo/apollo.cpp SUBTARGET=apollo \
  TOOLS=0 NOWERROR=1 -j4
```

`ccache` is worth installing before the first build rather than after: the
instrument → measure → revert loop below recompiles the same translation units
repeatedly, and a cache hit spawns no compiler at all.

`REGENIE=1` is needed on the first build so genie regenerates the makefiles for
the narrowed `SOURCES`, and `NOWERROR=1` keeps a warning in third-party code
from stopping a build we are not maintaining. The pinned checkout has no tags,
so MAME's version step prints `fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything`
— harmless, and not an error in our build.

### ROM sets

`tools/mame-oracle/romset.py` assembles them from `roms/firmware/` into
`out/roms/<machine>/`, which is gitignored, so no firmware can be staged.

Two properties make it trustworthy, and both are deliberate:

- **The ROM table is parsed from `apollo.cpp`, never transcribed.** A hardcoded
  table would be correct until the `ext/mame` pin moved and silently wrong
  after. Alias chains (`#define rom_dsp3500 rom_dn3500`) resolve too.
- **Our files are matched to MAME's by SHA-1, never by name.** Name matching
  would need a case-folding rule and then an exception to it; the SHA-1 is
  already in the driver and is what actually has to hold.

*Verified: all 11 apollo machines assemble, and the SHA-1 of every one of our
bitsavers images equals the one the driver declares — `3500_BOOT_12191_7.bin`
is `36f3c83d…`, `3000_BOOT_8475_7.bin` is `6c383d22…`, `5500_BOOT_A1631-80046`
is `7315a884…`. Our images are bit-for-bit the ROMs the oracle expects and
differ only in filename case.*

### What the oracle does not cover, from the driver itself

- `dn5500`, `dsp5500` and `dn5500_19i` are declared `MACHINE_NOT_WORKING`
  (`apollo.cpp` lines 1259–1261), while every 3000 and 3500 machine carries no
  such flag. If that flag reflects reality, **the entire 68040 path has no
  working oracle**, which would make Phase 2's "`dn5500` oracle diff"
  verification unachievable as written and reclassify DN5500/DSP5500 from
  `mame` to `paper` in the model table.
  **Not yet acted on: this is the driver's own claim about itself, and the
  honest test is to run it.** Recorded here so it is checked the moment the
  build finishes, rather than discovered in Phase 2.
- No ring ROM appears in any set, confirming from the driver source what
  `RING.md` already states from the manuals: MAME models no Apollo Token Ring.

## Where the ring is not

The Apollo Token Ring has **no runnable oracle at all**: MAME carries Domain
networking over an emulated 3c505 802.3 card instead. Ring figures therefore
never appear in this file as an oracle comparison. They live in
`docs/references/RING.md`, each citing `010005-00`, patent 4,716,575,
`008778-03`, or a ring-firmware disassembly address.

The one exception is the 3c505 itself, which *is* modelled by MAME: when that
path is implemented it gets ordinary rows here, like any other device.
